# AI Agent

This repository contains the code for an AI agent designed to interact with its environment through defined tools. The agent utilizes a modular architecture, allowing for easy extension and customization of its capabilities. Core functionalities include file system interaction, code execution, and task management. The agent is designed to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable steps. This project serves as a platform for experimenting with different AI models and task-solving strategies.
